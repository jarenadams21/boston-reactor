Classical
monochromatic plane waves correspond to the Dirac bras and kets; the light pulses
correspond to the wave functions ϕ; the classical Fourier expansion corresponds to the
Dirac basis expansions; the classical Fourier expansion provides the means to form light
pulses out of a continuous linear superposition of monochromatic plane waves, and the
Dirac basis expansions provide the means to form wave functions out of a continuous
linear superposition of bras and kets; the classical uncertainty principle of Fourier
Optics corresponds to the quantum uncertainty generated by the non-commutativity
of two observables [44]. However, although this analogy is very close from a formal
point of view, there is a crucial difference from a conceptual point of view. To wit,
whereas in the classical domain the solutions of the wave equations represent a physical
wave, in Quantum Mechanics the solutions of the equations do not represent a physical
object, but rather a probability amplitude—In Quantum Mechanics what is “waving”
is probability.
